What is Fortuno?
****************

Fortuno is a versatile and extensible unit testing framework designed specifically for the Fortran
programming language. The framework's name is a blend of "Fortran Unit-Testing Objects," but also
nods to the Esperanto word for "fortune," reflecting its aim to bring good fortune to Fortran
developers and their projects.

Fortuno offers a simple, user-friendly interface requiring only minimal amount of boiler-plate code
when writing unit tests. It puts strong emphasis on modularity and extensibility, providing a robust
foundation for creating customized unit testing environments. Fortuno is written in Fortran 2018 and
does not need any special pre-processing tools.

The framework supports a variety of testing styles and scenarios, including:

* straightforward unit tests for basic validation,

* fixtured tests initializing and finalizing test environments,

* parameterized tests that allow for varied input testing within the same test structure,

* nestable test containers to structure large test sets,

* serial unit testing for serial and OpenMP-threaded applications,

* parallel unit testing tailored for MPI- and coarray-parallelized projects, and

* smooth integration with both CMake and Fpm build systems.

Fortuno aims to enhance the quality and reliability of Fortran codebases, offering a practical tool
for Fortran developers seeking to incoprorate unit testing practices in their software development
lifecycle.
